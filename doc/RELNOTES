Creating documentation for a new release of AltOS

* Write release notes in release-notes-${version}.inc. Add to
  Makefile

* Make sure that doc/altusmetrum.txt has the right copyright 
  year

* Add references to that as appropriate from each of the
  documents:

	release-notes.inc
	easymini-release-notes.inc
	telegps-release-notes.inc

* Add release-notes-${version}.inc to git

* Make sure new hardware specs are documented in specs.inc
