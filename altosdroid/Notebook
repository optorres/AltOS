Desired AltosDroid feature list

 *) GPS satellite status tab. Monitor GPS C/N0 numbers and
    SVIDs. Provides more info before GPS lock is acquired.

 *) Channel scanning. Provide the ability to search for telemetry
    signals like AltosUI does.

 *) Random frequency selection. Provide some mechanism to input
    arbitrary radio frequencies. Could be like AltosUI which allows
    you to edit the list of frequencies and assign names to them,
    or perhaps something better.
  
 *) TM configuration from the droid

 *) Monitor-idle mode

 *) Frequency scanning

 *) Select satellite imaging mode

 *) TeleBT battery voltage

 *) Deal with long bluetooth list. Currently, a list longer than
    the screen makes it impossible to use entries off the bottom.

 *) Pickle/unpickle state instead of reloading entire history from
    file. Current restart time is lengthy.

Completed features

 *) Highlight current frequency in the frequency list.

	Placed current frequency in title bar

 *) Remember most-recently-used TBT and frequency, perhaps
    auto-connect at startup.

	Done
    
 *) Re-loading flight data from .telem file to get back to
    'find my rocket' mode after shutting down the application.

	Done

 *) Imperial Units mode

	Done
